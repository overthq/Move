# Move

Move is an app used to make payments for transportation services in public areas, via the scanning of QR codes.

## Motivation

Move is being built to solve the problem of transportation payments by enabling commuters to pay for trips by purchasing bus passes on their mobile devices.

## How it works

### For administrators

Through our admin dashboard, administrators are able to view information about trips, routes and users. We also present analytics, to help you make data-driven decisions about your transportation services. Other features include:

- Financial insights
- Scheduled payments to transportation staff

### For users

On the app, users are able to purchase bus passes, which will be verified by scanning a QR code on the means of transport, before the trip begins. Perks of using this service include:

- Mileage-based ride discounts
