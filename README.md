# Move

Move is an app used to make payments for transportation services in public areas, via the scanning of QR codes.

## Motivation

Move is being built to solve the problem of transportation payments by enabling commuters to pay for trips by purchasing bus passes on their mobile devices.

## How it works

### For administrators

Through our admin dashboard, administrators are able to view information about trips, routes and users. We also present analytics, to help you make data-driven decisions about your transportation services. Other features include:

- Financial insights
- Scheduled payments to transportation staff

### For users

On the app, users are able to purchase bus passes, which will be verified by scanning a QR code on the means of transport, before the trip begins. Perks of using this service include:

- Mileage-based ride discounts

## Technical Details

Although you could potentially host the service yourself, Move will primarily be a multi-tenant application, meaning that different entities can sign up for the service, and users can access the networks of all of them from the same client (our mobile app). Sort of the way Slack works.
